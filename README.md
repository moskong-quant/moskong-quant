## 🧠 About Me

I am a self-driven quantitative trader and trading systems developer with a strong focus on **crypto and DeFi markets**.  
My work sits at the intersection of **market microstructure, execution engineering, and risk-aware strategy design**.

Rather than optimizing for hype or backtest vanity metrics, I prioritize:

- Realistic execution assumptions  
- Liquidity & slippage awareness  
- Clear decision rules and failure analysis  
- Post-mortem driven system improvement  

Most of my projects originate from **failed ideas, observed market inefficiencies, and infrastructure pain points** encountered during live experimentation.

## 🧰 Core Tech Stack

- **Python** (AsyncIO, data pipelines, strategy logic)
- **Solana / DeFi** (Raydium, on-chain liquidity pools)
- **Arbitrage & Market Neutral Strategies**
- **Jupiter SDK / API** (execution routing)
- **REST & WebSocket APIs**
- **Docker** (reproducible environments)

## 🚀 Selected Projects

### 🔹 EMA Trend Crossover (`src6_EMA_Trend_Crossover`)
A classic trend-following strategy used as a **baseline research framework**.

- Full backtesting pipeline
- Parameter sensitivity analysis
- Risk & drawdown evaluation
- Designed to validate discipline, not curve-fitting

> Purpose: Establish a robust foundation before pursuing complex strategies.

---

### 🔹 Harvest Arbitrage (`src10_Harvest_Arbitrage`)
A multi-layer crypto arbitrage research & monitoring system.

- Spot ↔ Perpetual basis analysis
- Cross-venue price monitoring (CEX / DEX)
- Slippage, liquidity depth, and execution cost awareness
- On-chain price derivation from Raydium pools (Solana)

This project exposed real-world constraints such as:
- Thin liquidity
- Execution latency
- Basis instability
- Infrastructure fragility

> Some sub-strategies were intentionally **terminated** after post-mortem analysis  
> — discipline over bias.

## 📊 Research & Development Philosophy

- **No trade is better than a bad trade**
- If costs > expected edge → do not execute
- Strategies must survive *execution reality*, not just backtests
- Failure logs are as valuable as profitable runs
